# China-Packaging-Machine-Factory-Bottleneck
Nowadays, china packaging machine industry has step into a crossroads, a key moment of restructuring and adjustment. We are urgent to need think about the packaging machine development. And we should use new development ideas, new products and technologies, new <a href="http://www.beveragefillingmachine.com/news/china-packaging-machine-factory-bottleneck.html">international strategy</a>, opening up a new road of sustainable development.

According to statistics, paper packaging products can reach 36 million tons in 2015. By 2020, china packaging industry will meet the needs of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way. And we will build a new packaging industry with high technological content, good economic returns, low resource consumption, less environmental pollution, and full play of the advantages of human resources in China. Packaging industry has become a "sunrise" industry, the development potential is huge.

Due to the limited capital, <a href="http://www.beveragefillingmachine.com/group-packaging-machine">china packaging machine</a> factory want to break the bottleneck that the technology is limited at present. It is needed to choose the processing and packaging machinery with good cost performance and reasonable operation cost. Because of expensive price of machine in foreign countries, they put more hope in the relatively cheap price of domestic food packaging machinery.

Now the china <a href="http://www.beveragefillingmachine.com/group-packaging-machine">packaging machine factory</a> has formed a more perfect product system in common technology and conventional equipment. But the key equipment and technology canâ€™t make people satisfied. In the environment that china packaging machine factory develops rapidly, people have neglected that the development of food packaging machinery technology is an integral part of the development in this industry chain.
